# Welcome to My GitHub 👋

Hi there! I'm a third-year student of **Cybersecurity Engineering** at **Rey Juan Carlos University**. I'm passionate about everything related to the exciting world of **cybersecurity**.


I like to learn about **ethical hacking**, **pentesting**, **cryptography**... apart from that I like to participate in **CTFs** and I am an active user on platforms like **hack the box**, **tryhackme** or **portswigger**.
I also enjoy creating tools to **automate tasks** and simplify my daily workflow, especially on **UNIX-based operating systems**.
